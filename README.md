# ECR Armor
An armor mod for Rimworld

This mod adds endgame armors based on the existing Recon armor, rebalanced to make them more viable for colonies in extreme climates.

## Armors added

ECR Armor  - Similar to Recon Armor, but with better cold and heat protection
ECR Helmet - Same as above for the Recon Helmet

## TODO

- Add Prestige versions
- Add Locust/Grenadier/Other Variants
- Create unique graphics for these armors
